# Shallot

The Shallot project was started with the intent of creating software and protocols upon which people can anonymously assemble and share ideas and information.  The Internet was delivered with the promise of free access to information, zero censorship, and everyone having a voice.  Over the years these promises have been eroded and the 2020 elections have shown us the fruits of their labor:  clear collusion between big tech and mainstream media outlets with the intent of censoring information harmful to their political candidate of choice.  A survey of Biden voters after the election showed that 1 in 6 would have voted differently had they had access to the suppressed information.  The right to vote hinges on a well informed and free thinking populace and the effort to suppress information is no less than an effort to strip people of that right without their knowledge.  This outrage should reach us all and transcend our views on party or policy.  The goal of this project is to return a voice to the people that want it and access to original ideas and suppressed information to others.
